# Inventory Visualizer

**This is not an officially supported Google product.**

This project is aimed to create a visualizer application for segmented
timeseries data.

Time series forecasting is a pretty important area of machine learning. While we
invest lots of time to come up with a good model we often neglect the necessity
of a good visualization tool that helps us to to investigate a forecast in more
details. The aim of this project is to offer a standalone application and a
common infrastructure that would help us to visualize and investigate general
time series problem.
